# Accessibility Requirements

### Compliance Target

**Standard:** WCAG 2.1 AA (Level AA) for web content accessibility guidelines, ensuring usability for people with visual, motor, or cognitive impairments.

### Key Requirements

**Visual:**
- Color contrast ratios: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text (18pt+ or 14pt bold) against dark backgrounds.
- Focus indicators: Visible 2px amber outline (#FFBF00) on focused elements.
- Text sizing: Responsive scaling without breaking layout or readability.

**Interaction:**
- Keyboard navigation: Full tab order through all interactive elements (buttons, inputs, links); no mouse-only features.
- Screen reader support: ARIA labels on buttons, tables, and modals; semantic HTML for headings and lists.
- Touch targets: Minimum 44px for buttons and links on mobile devices.

**Content:**
- Alternative text: Descriptive alt text for icons and any images (e.g., "Download data as CSV").
- Heading structure: Logical H1-H3 hierarchy for screen readers.
- Form labels: Properly associated labels for search inputs and dropdowns.

### Testing Strategy

Manual and automated testing: Use WAVE or Axe tools for automated checks; test with NVDA/JAWS screen readers, keyboard-only navigation, and color contrast analyzers. Include mobile testing for touch accessibility and ensure no color-only feedback (e.g., add icons/text to status messages).
