# Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles

Subtle and purposeful animations to provide feedback and guide attention. Use easing curves for natural movement; limit animations to essential interactions (hovers, transitions) to avoid performance overhead. Ensure all animations respect user preferences for reduced motion.

### Key Animations

- **Button Hover:** Background fade to brighter amber for tactile feedback (Duration: 200ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Input Focus:** Border glow with amber outline for clarity (Duration: 150ms, Easing: ease)
- **Table Sort:** Column header highlight and arrow rotation for sorting feedback (Duration: 250ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Modal Transition:** Slide-in from top with fade for smooth overlays (Duration: 300ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Loading Spinner:** Continuous rotation for data loads (Duration: infinite, Easing: linear)
