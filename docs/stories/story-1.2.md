# Story 1.2 Implement JSON Data Loading

As a developer,  
I want to create a component that loads and parses embedded JSON datasets with metadata,  
so that the app can access and display word frequency data.  

### Acceptance Criteria
2.1: JSON files are placed in the data/ directory.  
2.2: A data loading function parses JSON and extracts words, frequencies, and metadata.  
2.3: Component renders loaded data in a simple list format.  
2.4: Error handling for invalid JSON or missing files.

### Status
Ready for Review

### Dev Notes
**Previous Story Insights:** Builds on Story 1.1; project structure and Svelte setup complete.

**Data Models:** Dataset and Word interfaces [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md].

**API Specifications:** No APIs; direct JSON fetch using fetch() [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Frontend Services Layer].

**Component Specifications:** Data loading component in src/components/ [Source: docs/architecture/components.md].

**File Locations:** data/ for JSON files, src/lib/data.js for loading function [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md].

**Testing Requirements:** Unit tests for data loading and parsing [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md].

**Technical Constraints:** Handle JSON parsing errors with try/catch [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md].

### Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] 1. Create sample JSON file in data/ with Dataset structure [AC: 2.1].
- [x] 2. Implement loadDataset function in src/lib/data.js to fetch and parse JSON [AC: 2.2].
- [x] 3. Create component to load and render data in list format [AC: 2.3].
- [x] 4. Add try/catch for invalid JSON or missing files [AC: 2.4].
- [x] 5. Unit test: Test data loading, parsing, and error handling [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md].

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude 3.5 Sonnet (2024-10-22)

### Debug Log References
None

### Completion Notes
- Created sample JSON dataset with Lithuanian word frequency data (ir, būti, tas, kad, su)
- Implemented `loadDataset()` function in `src/lib/data.js` with comprehensive validation and error handling
- Created `DataLoader.svelte` component with loading states, error display, and formatted word list
- Added JSDoc type annotations to ensure type safety
- Comprehensive unit test suite: 15 tests covering success cases, validation errors, and edge cases
- All tests pass successfully
- Build and type checking pass without errors
- Dev server running successfully at http://localhost:5173/

### File List
- `data/sample-dataset.json` - Sample Lithuanian word frequency dataset
- `static/data/sample-dataset.json` - Copy for runtime access
- `src/lib/data.js` - Data loading utility with validation
- `src/components/DataLoader.svelte` - Component to load and display datasets
- `src/routes/+page.svelte` - Updated to include DataLoader component
- `tests/unit/data.test.js` - Unit tests for data loading functionality
- `package.json` - Added test scripts
- `vite.config.ts` - Added Vitest configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - Excluded tests directory from type checking

### Change Log
- 2025-10-27: Implemented Story 1.2 - JSON data loading with full testing and validation

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: PASS with minor refactoring performed**

The implementation demonstrates solid engineering practices with comprehensive error handling, validation, and testing. The refactoring addressed a TypeScript standards compliance issue, converting JavaScript utilities to properly typed TypeScript.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `src/lib/data.js` → `src/lib/data.ts`
  - **Change**: Converted JavaScript utility to TypeScript with proper interfaces
  - **Why**: Coding standards require TypeScript for all utilities to ensure type safety
  - **How**: Added Dataset and Word interfaces, converted JSDoc to TypeScript types, ensured type safety throughout

- **File**: `src/components/DataLoader.svelte`
  - **Change**: Converted from JSDoc types to TypeScript with lang="ts"
  - **Why**: Improved type safety and consistency with project standards
  - **How**: Added TypeScript interfaces and proper typing for component variables

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ PASS (TypeScript usage for utilities now compliant)
- Project Structure: ✓ PASS (Files in correct locations per unified-project-structure.md)
- Testing Strategy: ✓ PASS (Comprehensive unit tests implemented per testing-strategy.md)
- All ACs Met: ✓ PASS (All 4 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested)

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Converted data.js to TypeScript for standards compliance (src/lib/data.ts)
- [x] Added proper TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- [x] Updated component to use TypeScript (src/components/DataLoader.svelte)
- [ ] Consider adding integration tests for component data loading (nice-to-have)
- [ ] Consider extracting data validation logic to separate validator utility (future enhancement)

### Security Review

**Status: PASS** - No security concerns identified
- Input validation prevents malformed data injection
- No user-controlled file paths (hardcoded to /data/ directory)
- Error messages don't expose system internals
- No authentication/authorization required for this feature

### Performance Considerations

**Status: PASS** - No performance issues identified
- Lightweight fetch operation with no heavy processing
- Efficient JSON parsing with early validation
- No memory leaks (proper error handling)
- Component uses Svelte's efficient reactivity

### Files Modified During Review

- `src/lib/data.js` → `src/lib/data.ts` (renamed and converted to TypeScript)
- `src/components/DataLoader.svelte` (converted to TypeScript)
- `tests/unit/data.test.js` (updated import path)

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/1.2-implement-json-data-loading.yml
Risk profile: Low (simple data loading feature with comprehensive testing)
NFR assessment: All NFRs satisfied (security, performance, reliability, maintainability)
