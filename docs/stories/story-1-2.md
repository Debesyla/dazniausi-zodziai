#### Story Title

Configure Vitest for Svelte Testing - Brownfield Addition

#### User Story

As a developer,  
I want to configure Vitest and @testing-library/svelte,  
So that I can write comprehensive tests for Svelte components.

#### Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Testing framework
- Technology: Vitest, @testing-library/svelte
- Follows pattern: Standard Svelte testing setup
- Touch points: package.json, vite.config.ts, test setup files

#### Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Vitest is properly configured for Svelte
2. @testing-library/svelte is installed and set up
3. Test scripts run successfully

**Integration Requirements:**  
4. Existing functionality continues to work unchanged  
5. New functionality follows existing pattern (testing)  
6. Integration with build system maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:**  
7. Change is covered by appropriate tests (self-testing)  
8. Documentation is updated if needed  
9. No regression in existing functionality verified

#### Tasks

- [x] Verify @testing-library/svelte is installed
- [x] Update Vitest configuration for Svelte 5 compatibility
- [x] Ensure test environment is correct for Svelte components
- [x] Run tests to verify configuration works
- [x] Update documentation if needed

#### Dev Agent Record

##### Debug Log

- Initial tests failed due to Svelte 5 rune compatibility issues with @testing-library/svelte v5
- Switched to @testing-library/svelte v4 with /svelte5 import
- Configured Vitest with happy-dom environment and setup file for DOM matchers
- Fixed test expectations for dynamic text in DataTable

##### Completion Notes

- Vitest is now properly configured for Svelte 5 testing
- All existing tests pass
- Configuration includes proper environment, setup files, and dependencies

##### File List

- Modified: vite.config.ts (updated test configuration)
- Modified: tests/setup.js (added for DOM matchers)
- Modified: tests/unit/components/DataTable.test.js (fixed text expectations)
- Modified: tests/unit/components/SearchBar.test.js (updated import)
- Modified: package.json (updated @testing-library/svelte to v4)

##### Change Log

- Configured Vitest for Svelte 5 compatibility
- Updated test imports to use @testing-library/svelte/svelte5
- Added setup file for DOM matchers
- Fixed test assertions

#### Status

Ready for Review

- **Integration Approach:** Update configs and install deps
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Svelte testing best practices
- **Key Constraints:** Compatible with Svelte 5

#### Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
