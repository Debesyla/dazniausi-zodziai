# Story 5.1 Generate Second Example Word Data JSON

As a developer,  
I want to create a second example .json file with sample Lithuanian word frequency data,  
so that users have multiple datasets to explore and compare.  

### Acceptance Criteria
5.1.1: Second JSON file (e.g., sample-dataset-2.json) is created in the data/ directory with realistic metadata and word lists.  
5.1.2: Data includes author, year, and varied word frequencies to demonstrate diversity.  
5.1.3: File is validated for correct JSON structure and compatibility with existing loading logic.  

### Tasks
- [x] 5.1.1: Second JSON file (e.g., sample-dataset-2.json) is created in the data/ directory with realistic metadata and word lists.
- [x] 5.1.2: Data includes author, year, and varied word frequencies to demonstrate diversity.
- [x] 5.1.3: File is validated for correct JSON structure and compatibility with existing loading logic.

### Status
Done

### Dev Notes
**Previous Story Insights:** Build on existing data loading from Epic 1. Ensure new JSON matches the schema of sample-dataset.json.

**Data Models:** Reuse the word object structure: {word: string, type: string, frequency: number}.

### Dev Agent Record

#### Agent Model Used
GitHub Copilot

#### Debug Log

#### Completion Notes
The sample-dataset-2.json file was already present in the data/ directory. Validated for correct JSON structure, schema compliance (author, year, words array with word, type?, frequency), and compatibility with the existing loadDataset function. File includes varied word frequencies and different metadata to demonstrate diversity.

#### File List
- data/sample-dataset-2.json

#### Change Log
- Validated existing sample-dataset-2.json for story requirements.

## QA Results

### Review Date: October 28, 2025

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
No code changes were made for this story. The existing JSON file adheres to the defined data schema and project standards.

### Refactoring Performed
None required - the data file is simple and compliant.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ No code changes, data file follows schema.
- Project Structure: ✓ File placed correctly in data/ directory.
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Existing data loading tests validate compatibility.
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria verified as implemented.

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Verified JSON structure and schema compliance
- [x] Confirmed compatibility with loadDataset function
- [x] Validated varied frequencies and metadata diversity

### Security Review
No security concerns - static JSON data with no sensitive information.

### Performance Considerations
File is small and static; no performance issues.

### Files Modified During Review
None.
