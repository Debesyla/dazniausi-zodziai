#### Story Title

Write New Svelte Tests - Brownfield Addition

#### User Story

As a developer,  
I want to write new tests for key components, routes, and functionality,  
So that the application is properly tested with Svelte-compatible tests.

#### Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Components and routes
- Technology: Vitest, @testing-library/svelte
- Follows pattern: Component testing
- Touch points: src/components/, src/routes/, test files

#### Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Tests written for main components
2. Tests written for routes
3. Tests written for key functionality

**Integration Requirements:**  
4. Existing functionality continues to work unchanged  
5. New functionality follows existing pattern (testing)  
6. Integration with build system maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:**  
7. Change is covered by appropriate tests (the new tests)  
8. Documentation is updated if needed  
9. No regression in existing functionality verified

#### Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Create test files alongside components
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Svelte testing patterns
- **Key Constraints:** Cover critical paths
