# Story 1.1 Setup Svelte Project Foundation

As a developer,  
I want to initialize a Svelte project with basic build configuration and a simple landing page,  
so that I have a runnable app foundation for further development.  

### Acceptance Criteria
1.1: Svelte project is created using the official template.  
1.2: Build and dev scripts are configured and functional.  
1.3: A basic page renders with project title and placeholder content.  
1.4: Repository is initialized with Git and basic structure (src/, data/).  

### Status
Ready

### Dev Notes
**Previous Story Insights:** This is the first story; no previous insights.

**Data Models:** No specific data models required for project setup.

**API Specifications:** No APIs; client-side only.

**Component Specifications:** Basic App.svelte for landing page [Source: docs/architecture/components.md].

**File Locations:** Project structure as defined in docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md: src/, data/, public/, package.json, svelte.config.js, vite.config.js.

**Testing Requirements:** No specific tests for setup; ensure build scripts work [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md].

**Technical Constraints:** Use Svelte 4.x, Vite 5.x [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md].
