Test Default Sort Behavior - Brownfield Addition

#### User Story

As a developer,  
I want to verify the default descending sort works across data sets,  
So that users see consistent behavior.

#### Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Testing framework, data loading
- Technology: Vitest, @testing-library/svelte
- Follows pattern: Integration testing
- Touch points: tests/, src/lib/data.ts

#### Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Default sort applies correctly on load
2. Works with different data sets
3. Manual sort overrides default as expected

**Integration Requirements:**  
4. Tests integrate with existing suite  
5. No interference with other functionality  

**Quality Requirements:**  
6. Tests cover various scenarios  
7. Documentation is updated if needed  
8. No regression in sort functionality

#### Tasks

- [x] Write tests for default sort on load
- [x] Test with multiple data sets
- [x] Verify manual sort interactions

#### Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Add to component tests
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Other sort tests
- **Key Constraints:** Use sample data

#### Definition of Done
