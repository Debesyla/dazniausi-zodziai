#### Story Title

Implement Type Filtering Logic - Brownfield Addition

#### User Story

As a developer,  
I want to add filtering logic to update the displayed words based on selected types,  
So that the table shows only words matching the selected types.

#### Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Data filtering, table display
- Technology: JavaScript, Svelte
- Follows pattern: Data filtering
- Touch points: Component with filter and table

#### Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Filtering logic implemented
2. Table updates reactively based on selection
3. Multiple types can be selected

**Integration Requirements:**  
4. Existing functionality continues to work unchanged  
5. New functionality follows existing pattern (filtering)  
6. Integration with data loading maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:**  
7. Change is covered by appropriate tests  
8. Documentation is updated if needed  
9. No regression in existing functionality verified

#### Tasks

- [x] Filtering logic implemented
- [x] Table updates reactively based on selection
- [x] Multiple types can be selected

#### Dev Agent Record

**Implementation Details:**

- Filtering logic was implemented in story 3-2 as part of the UI design. The filterWords function in utils.ts and utils.js was extended to accept an optional selectedTypes array, filtering words to only include those with types in the selected list.

- Table updates reactively via Svelte's derived state in DataLoader.svelte, where filteredWords is computed based on searchQuery and selectedTypes.

- Multiple types can be selected using checkboxes in the UI, bound to selectedTypes state.

**Debug Log References:**

- None

**Completion Notes List:**

- Filtering logic was already implemented in story 3-2. No additional changes required.

#### File List

- No new files modified for this story.

#### Change Log

- Added Tasks, Dev Agent Record, File List, Change Log sections.

#### Status

Ready for Review

- **Integration Approach:** Reactive filtering in component
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Svelte state management
- **Key Constraints:** Efficient filtering for performance

#### Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
