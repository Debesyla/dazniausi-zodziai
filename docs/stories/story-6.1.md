# Story 6.1 Translate UI Text to Lithuanian

As a developer,  
I want to replace all English text in the website with Lithuanian translations,  
so that the interface is fully accessible to Lithuanian-speaking users.  

### Acceptance Criteria
6.1.1: Identify all hardcoded text strings in components (e.g., labels, buttons, placeholders).  
6.1.2: Provide accurate Lithuanian translations for all text elements.  
6.1.3: Implement translations without breaking layout or functionality.  
6.1.4: Test for proper rendering of Lithuanian characters.  

### Status
Ready for Review

### Dev Notes
**Previous Story Insights:** Build on UI components from Epic 3. Ensure translations align with Baltic amber theme.

**Data Models:** No changes; focus on UI strings.
