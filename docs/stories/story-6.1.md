# Story 6.1 Translate UI Text to Lithuanian

As a developer,  
I want to replace all English text in the website with Lithuanian translations,  
so that the interface is fully accessible to Lithuanian-speaking users.  

### Acceptance Criteria
6.1.1: Identify all hardcoded text strings in components (e.g., labels, buttons, placeholders).  
6.1.2: Provide accurate Lithuanian translations for all text elements.  
6.1.3: Implement translations without breaking layout or functionality.  
6.1.4: Test for proper rendering of Lithuanian characters.  

### Status
Done

### Dev Notes
**Previous Story Insights:** Build on UI components from Epic 3. Ensure translations align with Baltic amber theme.

**Data Models:** No changes; focus on UI strings.

## QA Results

### Review Date: October 29, 2025

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
**Excellent implementation** - Clean, maintainable translation system with proper separation of concerns. The translation function provides good error handling and fallback behavior.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: `src/lib/translations.ts`
  - **Change**: Created centralized translation system
  - **Why**: Enables easy maintenance and future language support
  - **How**: Simple key-based lookup with dot notation support

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ All TypeScript, proper naming conventions followed
- Project Structure: ✓ Translation file properly placed in lib directory
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Unit tests updated with Lithuanian expectations
- All ACs Met: ✓ All four acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Security Review
No security concerns identified. Translation system uses static string lookups with no user input processing.

### Performance Considerations
Translation system is lightweight with no performance impact. All translations are static and loaded once.

### Files Modified During Review
None - implementation was complete and correct.
