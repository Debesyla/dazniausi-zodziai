# Story 5.2 Implement Data Source Switcher

As a user,  
I want to switch between available datasets via a UI control,  
so that I can easily compare and explore different word frequency data.  

### Acceptance Criteria
5.2.1: Dropdown or selector UI element added to the interface for dataset selection.  
5.2.2: Switching updates the displayed table, search, and download functionality dynamically.  
5.2.3: Maintains performance and responsiveness with dataset changes.  
5.2.4: Default to original dataset on load.  

### Status
Ready for Review

### Dev Notes
**Previous Story Insights:** Depends on 5.1 for the second dataset. Integrate with existing table and search components from Epic 2.

**Data Models:** Update data loading to support multiple sources; consider an array of datasets.
