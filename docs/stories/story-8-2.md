#### Story Title

Ensure Default Sort Persistence and Integration - Brownfield Addition

#### User Story

As a user,  
I want the default descending sort to persist on load and work with manual sorting,  
So that the experience is consistent and intuitive.

#### Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Sorting state, data loading
- Technology: Svelte, JavaScript
- Follows pattern: State persistence
- Touch points: src/components/DataTable.svelte, src/lib/data.ts

#### Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Default sort applies every time the page loads
2. Manual sorting changes are respected until reload
3. Sort integrates seamlessly with data updates

**Integration Requirements:**  
4. No conflicts with existing sort functionality  
5. State management handles default correctly  

**Quality Requirements:**  
6. Behavior is predictable across sessions  
7. Documentation is updated if needed  
8. No performance degradation

#### Tasks

- [x] Ensure default sort is set on component initialization
- [x] Test persistence across page reloads
- [x] Verify integration with manual sort changes

#### Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Set default in onMount or initial state
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Other persistent settings
- **Key Constraints:** Avoid overriding user actions

#### Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable

##### Completion Notes List

- Verified default sort is set on component initialization via initial $state values.
- Tested persistence: on component load, default descending sort applies (unit test confirms).
- Verified integration with manual sort changes: added unit test simulating click on frequency header, confirming sort toggles and order changes.
- No code changes needed as functionality was already implemented in story-8-1.

##### File List

- tests/unit/components/DataTable.test.js

##### Change Log

- Added test 'DataTable allows manual sorting to ascending' to verify manual sort integration.

##### Status
Ready for Review
