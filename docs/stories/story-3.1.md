# Story 3.1 Implement Baltic Amber Theme

As a user (Lithuanian linguist or enthusiast),  
I want the interface to feature a dark background with amber text and pixelated symbols,  
so that the app feels culturally inspired and engaging.  

### Acceptance Criteria
1.1: CSS applies dark BG and amber (#FFBF00) text colors.  
1.2: Pixelated symbols (e.g., amber icons) are added to buttons/elements.  
1.3: Theme is consistent across all components.  
1.4: Design evokes a terminal feel without hindering readability.
