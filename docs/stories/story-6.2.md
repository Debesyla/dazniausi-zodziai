# Story 6.2 Adapt UI for Lithuanian Language Support

As a user,  
I want the UI to accommodate Lithuanian text naturally,  
so that the experience feels native and intuitive.  

### Acceptance Criteria
6.2.1: Adjust component layouts if needed for longer Lithuanian text.  
6.2.2: Ensure Baltic amber theme remains consistent with localized content.  
6.2.3: Verify responsiveness and accessibility with Lithuanian text.  
6.2.4: Add language indicator or toggle if future multilingual support is planned.  

### Status
Ready for Review

### Dev Notes
**Previous Story Insights:** Depends on 6.1 for translations. Review responsive design from Epic 3.

**Data Models:** No changes; focus on UI adjustments.
