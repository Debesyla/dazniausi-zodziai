Analyze Data Display for Type Field - Brownfield Addition

#### User Story

As a developer,  
I want to analyze the current data display and identify the 'type' field usage,  
So that I can plan the filter implementation.

#### Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: DataTable.svelte, data structure

- Follows pattern: Data analysis
- Touch points: src/components/DataTable.svelte, data files

#### Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Current display of type field documented
2. Data structure confirmed
3. Filter integration points identified

**Integration Requirements:**  
4. Existing functionality continues to work unchanged  
5. New functionality follows existing pattern (analysis)  
6. Integration with table maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:**  
7. Change is covered by appropriate tests (none)  
8. Documentation is updated if needed  
9. No regression in existing functionality verified

#### Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Review component and data
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Component inspection
