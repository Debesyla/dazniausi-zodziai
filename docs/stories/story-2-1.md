#### Story Title

Review Dataset Selector Implementation - Brownfield Addition

#### Status

Ready for Review

#### User Story

As a developer,  
I want to review the current dataset selector implementation,  
So that I can identify hardcoded elements for dynamic replacement.

#### Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: +page.svelte
- Technology: Svelte
- Follows pattern: Code analysis
- Touch points: src/routes/+page.svelte

#### Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Current implementation documented
2. Hardcoded elements identified
3. Plan for dynamic loading outlined

**Integration Requirements:**  
4. Existing functionality continues to work unchanged  
5. New functionality follows existing pattern (analysis)  
6. Integration with UI maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:**  
7. Change is covered by appropriate tests (none)  
8. Documentation is updated if needed  
9. No regression in existing functionality verified

#### Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Read and analyze code
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Code review process
- **Key Constraints:** Understand current hardcoded options

#### Definition of Done

- [x] Functional requirements met
- [x] Integration requirements verified
- [x] Existing functionality regression tested
- [x] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [x] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [x] Documentation updated if applicable

#### Dev Agent Record

**Current Implementation Documentation:**

The dataset selector is implemented in `src/routes/+page.svelte` as a `<select>` element with two hardcoded `<option>` elements:

- `<option value="sample-dataset.json">{t('dataset1')}</option>`

- `<option value="sample-dataset-2.json">{t('dataset2')}</option>`

The `selectedFilename` state variable is initialized to `'sample-dataset.json'`.

**Hardcoded Elements Identified:**

- The filenames `'sample-dataset.json'` and `'sample-dataset-2.json'` are hardcoded in the template.

- The option values and initial selected value are hardcoded strings.

**Plan for Dynamic Loading Outlined:**

To enable dynamic loading, the application should dynamically retrieve the list of available JSON datasets from the `data/` directory. Possible implementation steps:

1. Use `import.meta.glob` to statically import all `.json` files in the `data/` folder.

2. Extract filenames from the glob results.

3. Populate an array of options with filename and possibly derived labels (e.g., from translations or filename parsing).

4. Bind the select to this dynamic array.

This would allow adding new datasets without code changes.

**Agent Model Used:** GitHub Copilot

**Debug Log References:** None

**Completion Notes List:**

- Reviewed `src/routes/+page.svelte` for dataset selector implementation.

- Identified hardcoded elements as specified.

- Outlined plan for dynamic loading.

**File List:** No files modified or added.

**Change Log:** No changes made to codebase.
