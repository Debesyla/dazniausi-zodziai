I want to review the current dataset selector implementation,  
So that I can identify hardcoded elements for dynamic replacement.

#### Story Context

- Integrates with: +page.svelte
- Technology: Svelte
- Follows pattern: Code analysis
- Touch points: src/routes/+page.svelte

#### Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Current implementation documented
2. Hardcoded elements identified
3. Plan for dynamic loading outlined

**Integration Requirements:**  
4. Existing functionality continues to work unchanged
