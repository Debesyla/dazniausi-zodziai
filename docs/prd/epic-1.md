# Testing Framework Overhaul - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Completely remove the existing testing setup and implement a new testing framework that integrates seamlessly with Svelte to ensure accurate and reliable testing of the application.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: The application has Playwright for e2e testing and Vitest for unit testing, but the tests may not be working correctly with Svelte.
- Technology stack: Svelte 5, Vite, Vitest, Playwright
- Integration points: Tests run on components and the built app

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Remove all existing tests and configurations, set up a proper testing framework using Vitest with @testing-library/svelte for unit and integration tests, and optionally reconfigure or replace Playwright if needed.
- How it integrates: Tests will target Svelte components and routes directly.
- Success criteria: All new tests pass, coverage is adequate, CI/CD pipeline updated.

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** Remove existing Playwright tests and configuration files.
2. **Story 2:** Configure Vitest and @testing-library/svelte for comprehensive Svelte testing.
3. **Story 3:** Write new tests for key components, routes, and functionality.

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Existing APIs remain unchanged
- [ ] Database schema changes are backward compatible
- [ ] UI changes follow existing patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Removing tests might leave gaps in QA.
- **Mitigation:** Implement new tests immediately after removal.
- **Rollback Plan:** Restore from git if needed.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing
- [ ] Integration points working correctly
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately
- [ ] No regression in existing features
