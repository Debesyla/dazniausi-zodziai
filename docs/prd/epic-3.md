# Word Type Filter - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Implement the ability to filter words by 'Tipas' (word type) to allow users to narrow down the displayed dataset based on word categories.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: Words are displayed in a table or list, with possible search functionality, but no filtering by word type.
- Technology stack: Svelte, JavaScript
- Integration points: Data loading, table component, and user interface

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Add a filter control (e.g., dropdown or checkboxes) for selecting 'Tipas' values to filter the word list.
- How it integrates: Integrate filter logic into the data display and search components.
- Success criteria: Users can select one or more word types, and the display updates to show only matching words.

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** Analyze current data display and identify 'Tipas' field usage.
2. **Story 2:** Design and implement the filter UI for word types.
3. **Story 3:** Add filtering logic to update the displayed words based on selected types.

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Existing APIs remain unchanged
- [ ] Database schema changes are backward compatible
- [ ] UI changes follow existing patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Filtering might affect performance with large datasets.
- **Mitigation:** Implement efficient filtering and pagination if needed.
- **Rollback Plan:** Remove filter UI if issues occur.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing
- [ ] Integration points working correctly
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately
- [ ] No regression in existing features
