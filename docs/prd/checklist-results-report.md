# Checklist Results Report

## Executive Summary
- **Overall PRD Completeness:** 95% (most sections fully addressed based on brief and template).  
- **MVP Scope Appropriateness:** Just Right (focused on core features, clear boundaries).  
- **Readiness for Architecture Phase:** Ready (technical assumptions and epics provide solid foundation).  
- **Most Critical Gaps:** Minor refinements in data requirements and integration (no blockers).

## Category Statuses

| Category                         | Status  | Critical Issues |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | --------------- |
| 1. Problem Definition & Context  | PASS    | None            |
| 2. MVP Scope Definition          | PASS    | None            |
| 3. User Experience Requirements  | PASS    | None            |
| 4. Functional Requirements       | PASS    | None            |
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements   | PASS    | None            |
| 6. Epic & Story Structure        | PASS    | None            |
| 7. Technical Guidance            | PASS    | None            |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | PARTIAL | Data migration and schema changes not detailed (not applicable for static site). |
| 9. Clarity & Communication       | PASS    | None            |

## Critical Deficiencies
- No major deficiencies; PRD is well-structured and aligned with brief.  
- Partial in cross-functional due to static nature (no data storage/migration needed).

## Recommendations
- No blockers; proceed to architecture.  
- For future iterations, add data schema details if dynamic features expand.  
- Ensure stakeholder review of epics before development.

## Final Decision
- **READY FOR ARCHITECT**: The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design.
