# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
A minimalist, terminal-inspired interface that transforms exploring Lithuanian word frequency data into an engaging, culturally immersive experience, resembling an ancient Baltic artifact while ensuring intuitive navigation and quick access to insights for linguists and students.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- Table sorting via column header clicks (A-Z, frequency ascending/descending).  
- Real-time search filtering as users type in the search bar.  
- One-click download of filtered or full datasets.  
- Dataset selection via dropdown or list for switching between loaded JSON files.

## Core Screens and Views
- Dataset Selection Screen: Initial view to choose and load a dataset with metadata display.  
- Main Data Table View: Central screen showing sortable, searchable table of words and frequencies.  
- Download Confirmation View: Simple modal or overlay for export options.

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Basic accessibility compliance to ensure usability for users with disabilities, including keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and color contrast in the amber theme.

## Branding
Incorporate a distinctive Baltic amber terminal aesthetic: dark background, amber-colored text and accents, pixelated symbols (e.g., amber drops or ancient motifs) for buttons and icons, evoking a retro terminal feel while honoring Lithuanian cultural heritage.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Optimized for modern web browsers on desktop and mobile devices, ensuring the table and interactions adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.
