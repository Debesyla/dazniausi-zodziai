## Background Context  
This project addresses the challenge of inaccessible Lithuanian word frequency data from various researchers, which exists in raw tab-separated files. By creating a static Svelte-based website, we provide an interactive, culturally-inspired interface for linguists, researchers, and students to browse, filter, download, and compare datasets. The solution emphasizes a unique Baltic amber terminal design to make data exploration engaging, filling a gap where generic tools fail to cater to Lithuanian linguistic needs. This initiative supports digital preservation of language data and enhances accessibility for academic and educational purposes.
