# Dažniausi lietuviški žodžiai Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Launch the website within 2 weeks of development start.  
- Achieve 100 unique visitors in the first month post-launch.  
- Enable at least 50 data downloads in the first quarter.  
- Users can filter and sort data within 30 seconds of landing.  
- 80% of users complete at least one comparison or download.  
- Positive feedback on design and usability in surveys.  
- Page load time under 2 seconds.  
- Bounce rate below 40%.  
- User session duration over 5 minutes.  

### Background Context  
This project addresses the challenge of inaccessible Lithuanian word frequency data from various researchers, which exists in raw tab-separated files. By creating a static Svelte-based website, we provide an interactive, culturally-inspired interface for linguists, researchers, and students to browse, filter, download, and compare datasets. The solution emphasizes a unique Baltic amber terminal design to make data exploration engaging, filling a gap where generic tools fail to cater to Lithuanian linguistic needs. This initiative supports digital preservation of language data and enhances accessibility for academic and educational purposes.

## Requirements

### Functional
FR1: The application must load JSON-formatted datasets containing metadata such as author, year, and word lists with frequencies.  
FR2: Display loaded words in a sortable table view, allowing sorting by word (A-Z) and frequency count.  
FR3: Include a search bar to filter words by text input.  
FR4: Enable users to download the displayed data in a suitable format (e.g., CSV or JSON).  

### Non Functional
NFR1: Page load time must be under 2 seconds for datasets up to 10 files.  
NFR2: The interface must be responsive and functional on modern browsers across desktop and mobile devices.  
NFR3: Incorporate a distinctive Baltic amber terminal design with dark background, amber text, and pixelated symbols for a culturally-inspired aesthetic.  
NFR4: Ensure the application remains static with no server-side processing, relying solely on client-side loading.  

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
A minimalist, terminal-inspired interface that transforms exploring Lithuanian word frequency data into an engaging, culturally immersive experience, resembling an ancient Baltic artifact while ensuring intuitive navigation and quick access to insights for linguists and students.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- Table sorting via column header clicks (A-Z, frequency ascending/descending).  
- Real-time search filtering as users type in the search bar.  
- One-click download of filtered or full datasets.  
- Dataset selection via dropdown or list for switching between loaded JSON files.

### Core Screens and Views
- Dataset Selection Screen: Initial view to choose and load a dataset with metadata display.  
- Main Data Table View: Central screen showing sortable, searchable table of words and frequencies.  
- Download Confirmation View: Simple modal or overlay for export options.

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Basic accessibility compliance to ensure usability for users with disabilities, including keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and color contrast in the amber theme.

### Branding
Incorporate a distinctive Baltic amber terminal aesthetic: dark background, amber-colored text and accents, pixelated symbols (e.g., amber drops or ancient motifs) for buttons and icons, evoking a retro terminal feel while honoring Lithuanian cultural heritage.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Optimized for modern web browsers on desktop and mobile devices, ensuring the table and interactions adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
A single repository containing all source code, data files, and documentation for simplicity in a solo-developer setup.

### Service Architecture
Client-side only architecture with no backend or database; data loaded statically from embedded JSON files, ensuring a fully static site deployable to free hosting like GitHub Pages or Netlify.

### Testing Requirements
Unit testing for components and functions, plus integration testing for data loading and UI interactions to validate end-to-end functionality without a full pyramid (given static nature and no server-side logic).

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- Frontend framework: Svelte for building the static single-page application.  
- Hosting: GitHub Pages or Netlify for free, static deployment.  
- Data format: Pre-converted tab-separated files to JSON with metadata.  
- Performance: Optimize for fast loads by keeping datasets small and using Svelte's efficiency.  
- Browser support: Modern browsers only, as specified.  
- No APIs or external integrations required.
